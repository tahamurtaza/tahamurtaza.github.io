     <h2>Statistics about the future of work can be scary. Automation, digitization, and other forms of technology threaten to wipe out millions of jobs. The skills that fuel so many jobs today will be rendered obsolete by what’s called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0 for short. That’s particularly frightening in the Middle East and North Africa, where youth unemployment already hovers around 75%.</h2>

   <p>In today's world, as poverty, conflicts, natural disasters and epidemics are becoming more frequent and complex, children are often denied their right to education. Never before in humankind’s history, has the urgency for education been more important. To respond to this urgent need, the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) adopted unanimously a resolution to observe 24th January as the International Day of Education. This historic decision by the United Nations demonstrates the global community’s unwavering political will towards providing quality education to all and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Moreover, it reiterates the key role of education in building sustainable and resilient societies and contributing to the achievement of the other SDGs.

<br>
    On the occasion of the first ever International Day of Education, I would like us all to take a moment and reflect on the significance of this day. This celebration prompts us to intensify our efforts to bridge the gap by bringing more and more children and young people into the education system. To achieve this, education should be inclusive, universal in its principles and local in its impact, and effectively used to equip children and young people with the capacities and qualities necessary to address the challenges that humanity is facing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Education is one of the essential pillars of sustainable development. Without substantial investment in human capital, countries cannot achieve sustainable economic development. Education enriches people's understanding of themselves and their surrounding world. It improves the quality of their lives and leads to broad social benefits to individuals and society. Education increases people's productivity and creativity and promotes entrepreneurship and technological advances. In addition, it plays a very crucial role in making economic and social progress and improving income distribution. Not to mention, education is central to building peace, as exclusion and inequity exacerbate disparities and conflicts. Moreover, education plays a pivotal role in spreading the values of tolerance across communities and societies.
    <br>
    <br>
    Education is a right of all children and youth, regardless of their gender, race, religion or nationality. It is time to ensure that this right is upheld at all levels. Education is the passport to a prosperous future and enables children and young people to make a difference in their communities.
    
    By observing this international day, the global community has voiced a strong message recognizing the instrumental role of education for peace and development. As a global philanthropic organization, we commend the adoption of this resolution, as it demonstrates the unwavering political will to support transformative actions for inclusive, equitable and quality education for all.
    
    Dedicating a day in the calendar for education marks a new beginning for the international community to understand the urgency of this cause, and for the global education stakeholders to push their agenda forward. Without a strong and united front for change, a collective and articulated vision, significant financial commitments and a sense of urgency to prioritize education, the world will continue to see generations of children and youth missing out on an education they so desperately need.
    <br>
    <br>
    Governments should work hand in hand with private sector and civil-society organizations, as well as parent and teacher associations, to come up with the best and most constructive and innovative ways to improve the quality of education around the world. Joint efforts are necessary to put in place policies and laws to maximize the positive effects of education on sustainable development and peace; and develop strategies to mobilize political support to increase funding for education.
    
    This resolution is in line with Dubai Cares’ vision and strengthens the organization’s commitment to this noble cause. It also provides an opportunity to raise awareness and build momentum about the importance of providing underprivileged children and young people access to education, as well as an international platform that will amplify Dubai Cares’ actions. The International Day of Education will provide an additional impetus for Dubai Cares’ continuous quest to craft effective and innovative solutions to the global education challenges.
    
    By supporting quality education for all, we can ensure children and young people will reach their full potential, contributing to the wellbeing of their communities and nations, and contributing to the prosperity of our world. Education is not a privilege; it is a fundamental human right. Therefore, we should leave no one behind.</p>
