<h2>Dubai Cares has been organizing various community-based back to school initiatives that aim to provide better access and learning opportunities for school children around the developing world. In 2019, around 2,000 volunteers participated in a four day event during the holy month of Ramadan to pack 50,000 school bags with essential stationaries and learning kits to be distributed to school children who are unable to afford basic school supplies, of which 30,000 bags are being distributed in over 700 primary schools in the Kaolack region in Senegal.</h2>
