     <h2>Dubai Cares and UAE Ministry of Education launch Education Uninterrupted campaign to ensure equitable access to distance learning among all UAE children and youth
    </h2>
   <hr>

    This campaign hopes to alleviate the burden on parents who are playing a key role in their children’s distance learning as well as support teachers in their effort to continue delivering quality education to students during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby joining doctors, nurses and medical staff in being the community’s first line of defense during these challenging times.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    H.E. Jameela Bint Salem Al-Muhairi, Minister of State for Public Education said, “Education Uninterrupted, a campaign launched by the Ministry of Education and Dubai Cares, is a reflection of the unity of the UAE community, both individuals and organizations. It offers everyone an opportunity to support students in the UAE by enabling them to continue their education during these challenging times witnessed by our nation and the rest of the world due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The UAE is the fruit of the wise vision of our founding fathers who established the nation on a foundation of eternal values that continue to live in us today. Because of that vision and those values, we are today living in a nation defined by co-existence and giving, and this is something that we need to do our best to support by enabling the nation’s students to complete this academic year without any obstacles and provide them with the ICT devices and tools they need.”
    
    Praising Dubai Cares and all other organizations that are supporting this campaign by providing ICT devices and tools to students, H.E. Jameela Bint Salem Al-Muhairi concluded, “This is a true reflection of the values and commitment by national organizations towards social responsibility”.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The campaign which is ensuring that the education of children and youth in the UAE is not interrupted, is currently accepting donations from UAE-based public and private sector organizations as well as individuals either online through Dubai Cares’ website (dubaicares.ae/donate); or through SMS via Etisalat and du - the campaign’s telecom partners - by texting “donate” to 9030 to donate AED 30, to 9090 to donate AED 90, 9300 to donate AED 300, and 9900 to donate AED 900; or through cheque, ATM deposit, and bank transfer to:
